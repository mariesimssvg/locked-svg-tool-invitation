Transmission brief for a locked SVG conversion tool. Refusal-grade logic, collective authorship, and embedded metadata. No stylization. No ownership.
Invitation to Build a Locked SVG Tool
Artists need a way to convert finished files (PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF) into locked SVGs with embedded metadata:
• 	Clean paths
• 	<author>TEAM@YELLOW BOARDS</author>
• 	<rights>ALL RIGHTS PRESERVED</rights>
• 	No editable layers
I don’t want to own this. I want it built.
You’re free to host it, present it, or claim the glory—so long as the refusal logic holds.
If you resonate, I’ll share the full transmission brief.
